Good afternoon.
If you are reading this, then you are checking my work as part of a test assignment for the position of "Junior-C# programmer .NET" 
to the company " MONQ Digital lab". 
Here I will tell you a little about what I used to do this work.

As an IDE, I used Rider 20.3.2, .NET Core 3.1.0 and 
ASP.net the latest version available for this platform.

The DBMS is PostgreSQL.
ORM-Dapper in conjunction with NpgSQL.
The script for creating the database is in the DBCreator.sql file.
For manual testing, I used Postman

Many things in the program are done as I interpreted the task, 
and within the framework of the architecture vision. 
I hope it will not be difficult for you to read my program.
Thank you for reading this to the end.
